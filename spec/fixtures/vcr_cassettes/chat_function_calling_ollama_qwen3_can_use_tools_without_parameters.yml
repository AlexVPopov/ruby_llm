        the user asked, \"What''s the best language to learn?\" and I called the function
        best_language_to_learn. The response from the tool was \"Ruby\". Now I need
        to present this answer clearly. Let me check if there''s any context or reasoning
        needed. The function''s description says it gets the best language, so the
        answer is straightforward. I should just state that Ruby is the best language
        to learn. Maybe add a brief reason why Ruby is considered the best, like its
        simplicity and versatility. But since the tool''s response is just \"Ruby\",
        I''ll stick to that and maybe mention it''s a popular choice for beginners
        and versatile for web development. Keep it concise and helpful.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThe
        best language to learn is **Ruby**. It is widely appreciated for its simplicity,
        readability, and versatility, making it an excellent choice for both beginners
        and experienced developers. Ruby is commonly used for web development, scripting,
        and automation, and its elegant syntax contributes to efficient code writing."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":273,"completion_tokens":204,"total_tokens":477}}
