        from Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz), the creator of Ruby. It explains the terms
        under which Ruby is distributed as free software. Key points include:\n\n-
        Ruby is copyrighted free software by Yukihiro Matsumoto.\n- You may **redistribute
        and/or modify** Ruby under the conditions of either the **2-clause BSD License**
        (BSDL) or the terms explicitly described in this file.\n- You can distribute
        verbatim copies of the source without restrictions, as long as copyright notices
        and disclaimers are preserved.\n- Modifications are allowed if you do one
        of several things such as making modifications public, using the modified
        software only within an organization, naming non-standard binaries differently,
        or arranging distribution with the author.\n- Distribution of object code
        or binaries requires accompanying instructions or source, or other arrangements
        similar to modified software.\n- Some parts of Ruby are not under this license
        but have their own conditions, detailed in the separate LEGAL file.\n- Scripts
        or libraries produced by the software do not automatically fall under Ruby\u2019s
        copyright and can be sold or aggregated separately.\n- The software is provided
        as-is without any warranties, including warranties of merchantability or fitness
        for a particular purpose.\n\nThis license effectively provides a **free, permissive,
        and flexible framework** to use, modify, and redistribute Ruby, either under
        this custom license or alternatively the 2-clause BSD License[2][3]. It is
        dual-licensed for user convenience, allowing Ruby and derivative works to
        be broadly and freely used, including in commercial settings.\n\nThis file
        corresponds to the known description of the Ruby License, which is recognized
        as a free software license with an explicit dual-licensing clause (Ruby License
        or 2-clause BSD)[1][3]."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
