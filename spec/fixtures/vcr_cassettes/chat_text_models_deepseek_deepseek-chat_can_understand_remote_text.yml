        Ruby. Here''s a summary of its contents:\n\n### Key Points of the Ruby License:\n1.
        **Copyright**: Ruby is copyrighted free software by Yukihiro Matsumoto (\"Matz\").\n2.
        **Redistribution & Modification**: You can redistribute/modify it under either:\n   -
        The 2-clause BSDL (referenced separately), **or**\n   - The conditions listed
        in this file.\n\n### Main Conditions:\n1. **Verbatim Copies**: Allowed if
        original copyright/disclaimers are preserved.\n2. **Modifications**: Allowed
        if at least one of these is met:\n   - Make modifications public domain/freely
        available (e.g., Usenet).\n   - Use modified software only internally.\n   -
        Give non-standard binaries unique names + instructions to get the original.\n   -
        Arrange distribution terms with the author.\n3. **Binary/Object Code Distribution**:
        Allowed if at least one of these is met:\n   - Include instructions to get
        the original source.\n   - Provide machine-readable source with binaries.\n   -
        Use non-standard names for non-standard binaries.\n   - Arrange terms with
        the author.\n4. **Inclusion in Other Software**: Allowed, but some files (listed
        in `LEGAL`) have different terms.\n5. **Scripts/Library Files**: Generated
        files (input/output) are not covered by Ruby''s copyright and can be sold/commercially
        used.\n6. **No Warranty**: The software is provided \"AS IS\" without warranties
        (merchantability/fitness for a purpose).\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The license
        references other files (`BSDL`, `LEGAL`) for specific details.\n- It is a
        **permissive license** (similar to BSD/MIT), allowing commercial use and modification
        under clear but flexible terms.\n\nThis is the standard Ruby license used
        for versions before Ruby 2.0.0 (later versions adopted the more common 2-clause
        BSDL)."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":543,"completion_tokens":423,"total_tokens":966,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":543},"system_fingerprint":"fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache"}'
