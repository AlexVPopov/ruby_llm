        I need to figure out who created Ruby. Let me start by recalling what I know
        about Ruby. Ruby is a programming language, right? I think it was created
        by someone named Yukihiro Matsumoto. Wait, wasn''t his name sometimes transliterated
        differently? Like Matz? I''ve heard that name before. But I should make sure
        I''m not confusing it with another language or person.\n\nLet me think. Ruby
        is known for its elegant syntax and being a dynamic, interpreted language.
        It''s used for web development, scripting, and other applications. Matsumoto
        is often referred to as \"Matz.\" I remember that he designed Ruby with a
        focus on simplicity and productivity. But was he the sole creator? I''m not
        sure if there were other contributors, but the primary figure is definitely
        Matsumoto.\n\nI should check if there''s any other person associated with
        Ruby''s creation. Sometimes, languages have multiple designers or contributors.
        For example, Python was created by Guido van Rossum. So, for Ruby, I think
        Yukihiro Matsumoto is the main creator. Maybe there were others involved in
        the development, but he''s the one who started it. Also, I recall that the
        first version of Ruby was released in 1995. That aligns with Matsumoto''s
        timeline. \n\nWait, could there be a different person? Let me think. There''s
        a Ruby on Rails framework by David Heinemeier Hansson, but that''s separate
        from the language itself. The Ruby language itself is definitely Matsumoto''s
        creation. I''m pretty confident that Yukihiro Matsumoto, known as Matz, is
        the creator. I don''t think there''s another person usually associated with
        Ruby''s creation. So, the answer should be Yukihiro Matsumoto, also known
        as Matz.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nRuby was created by **Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto**,

        the user previously asked who created Ruby, and I answered Matz. Now they''re
        asking the specific year he created Ruby. Let me recall.\n\nI remember that
        Ruby was developed in the mid-90s. Matz started working on it around 1993,
        and the first version was released in 1995. So the key here is to confirm
        the exact year. The user might be looking for the release year rather than
        the start of development. I should make sure to mention the first release
        date. Also, maybe mention that the development started a bit earlier, but
        the official release was 1995. Need to check if there''s a specific version
        number or any other details, but I think 1995 is the correct year for the
        initial release. The user might be a programmer or a student trying to understand
        Ruby''s history. They could be preparing for an exam or just curious. I should
        keep the answer straightforward and confirm the year without any confusion.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nYukihiro
        \"Matz\" Matsumoto created Ruby, and the **first version of Ruby (Ruby 0.3)**
        was officially released in **1995**. Development began around 1993, but the
        initial public release came in 1995. This marked the beginning of Ruby''s
        journey as a dynamic, open-source programming language."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":143,"completion_tokens":287,"total_tokens":430}}
