        in the city proper and over 12 million in the greater \u00cele-de-France region
        as of recent estimates. It has been the capital since 508 AD under King Clovis,
        with a brief interruption during World War II when Vichy was the capital during
        German occupation[1]. Known as the \"City of Light\" and the \"City of Love,\"
        Paris is renowned for its rich history, iconic landmarks such as Notre Dame
        Cathedral and the Louvre, its fashion, gastronomy, and role as a global hub
        of culture and commerce[2][3][4]."}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content":
