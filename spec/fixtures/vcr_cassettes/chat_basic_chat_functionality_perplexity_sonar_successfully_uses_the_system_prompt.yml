        "content": "The weather today, August 17, 2025, is characterized by a transition
        to more comfortable conditions with lower humidity and heat due to a high-pressure
        system moving in. In Milwaukee, for example, temperatures are around 75\u00b0F
        inland and about 70\u00b0F near Lake Michigan, with gusty northeast winds
        around 13 mph and frequent clouds but no heavy rain expected. Tonight, temperatures
        will drop to the mid-60s inland and lakeside, with variable winds influenced
        by local geography and air masses[1][5].\n\nIn other regions, such as South
        Florida, drier air is moving in, reducing the chance of rain, though isolated
        showers or storms may still occur near beaches or inland areas. The overall
        pattern includes mostly sunny to partly cloudy skies with occasional chances
        of rain over the next several days, with highs generally in the 70s to 90s
        Fahrenheit depending on location[2][3].\n\nWeather, in general, refers to
        the atmospheric conditions including temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation
        at a given time and place. Forecasts help people plan activities and prepare
        for changes such as storms or heat waves. Tropical weather tends to be more
        variable and harder to predict than weather at higher latitudes due to differences
        in solar heating and atmospheric circulation[4].\n\nXKCD7392"}, "delta": {"role":
