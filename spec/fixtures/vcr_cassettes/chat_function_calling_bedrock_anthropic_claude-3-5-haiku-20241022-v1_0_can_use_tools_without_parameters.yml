        to the tool, Ruby is the best language to learn! \n\nRuby is a dynamic, object-oriented
        programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It''s particularly
        popular for web development, especially with the Ruby on Rails framework.
        Ruby is often praised for its elegant syntax that makes coding more intuitive
        and enjoyable.\n\nSome reasons why Ruby might be considered a great language
        to learn include:\n1. Easy to read and write\n2. Versatile for web development\n3.
        Strong community support\n4. Used in many startups and tech companies\n5.
        Good for beginners due to its clear syntax\n\nOf course, the \"best\" language
        can depend on your specific goals, such as web development, data science,
        mobile apps, etc. But Ruby is certainly an excellent choice for many programming
        enthusiasts!\n\nWould you like to know more about Ruby or discuss why it might
        be a good fit for your programming journey?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":398,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":199}}'
