        the user asked, \"What''s 2 + 2?\" That''s a basic math question. Let me make
        sure I understand it correctly. They''re asking for the sum of 2 and 2. I
        can just answer 4 directly, but maybe they want a more detailed explanation?
        Wait, the original question was straightforward. Maybe they''re testing if
        I know the basics? Or perhaps they want to see if I can handle simple arithmetic.
        Let me check if there''s any context I''m missing. The user didn''t provide
        any additional information, so it''s just a simple addition problem. In that
        case, the answer is definitely 4. But I should confirm that there''s no trick
        or alternative interpretation. For example, in some contexts, symbols might
        have different meanings, but in standard arithmetic, 2 + 2 equals 4. So the
        answer is 4. I should present it clearly and concisely.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nThe
        sum of 2 and 2 is **4**. \n\n**Answer:** 4"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":16,"completion_tokens":214,"total_tokens":230}}
